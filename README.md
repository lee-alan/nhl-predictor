# nhl-predictor

A statistical model which can predict winners in NHL games. It is based on the (homogenous)Poisson distribution and utilizes data gathered from the 2019-2020 NHL season. 
It performs regression analysis to come up with relative team strengths, taking into account home-ice advantage, and feeds the results to a match simulator which
produces a probability matrix; from there the probabilities of the Home Team winning, Away Team winning, or an Overtime/Shootout 
result can be calculated using simple matrix operations.

Probability predictions for the 2020 NHL Playoffs generated by the model:

Linear Regression results showing Offensive/Defensive strength coefficients of each NHL Team:
(Take e^Coefficient to un-log the scale and obtain a coefficient which displays strength relative to average team, i.e e^0 = 1 = perfectly average)

Conclusion: 

This model is based off simple Poisson. This inherently is a drawback because goals scored in games are not always independent. For example, in a 1 goal game with 1 minute left, the chance of scoring is likely higher. Another consideration is the accuracy of statistics. I used datasets from https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2020_games.html. But goals scored can be deceiving in that sometimes teams may have injuries or very good games where they score an abnormal number of goals, etc; this influences and skews results. Also, the model is a homogenous Poisson process, hence it assumes goals are scored uniformly throughout 3 periods, this is unlikely to be the case. Thus suggestions for improvement include utilizing non-homogenous Poisson processes, research suggests the Weibull distribution may be a good candidate.
